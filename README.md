# java-windows-check-battery-status

## Description

This simple script comes from the laziness of having to run the command from cmd <br>
every time and indicate the save location of the battery report for Windows, <br>
nothing else; 

To run it just clone the reposotory build the executable jar and double click waiting <br>
time of about 0.750 seconds, if set to a lower interval you will get an error for file <br>
not found since it is being written by Windows.

## Compatibility
***Tested on:***
- Windows 11
